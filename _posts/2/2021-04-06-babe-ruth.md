## Who is Babe Ruth
                  
                  
                  
Revered by many as the greatest baseball player of all time, he set career records for home runs, RBIs, and bases on balls that have since been broken. He won 7 World Series Championships, 12 American League home run titles, 6 AL RBI titles and the 1924 AL batting title. He played for the New York Yankees from 1920 to 1934 after the Boston Red Sox traded him in exchange for cash.
