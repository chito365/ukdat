## Who is Justice McCort



Award-winning dancer known from the Lifetime show Dance Moms. He was on several episodes of the first two seasons, but left the Candy Apples elite competition team in 2012. He moved on to dance at Krystie&#8217;s Dance Academy in Ohio. 

                
                
                
## Prior to Popularity



He was brought on to the show because of his strength as a solo dancer and held many on-screen solos while on the show. In 2012 he won Mast Dance of America but his involvement with Dance Moms caused controversy in the dance community, which many think is the reason he discontinued his appearances on the show.
