## Who is Herman Melville



A towering figure in American literature, Melville is the author of several seafaring tales, including &#8220;Billy Budd, Sailor,&#8221; &#8220;Typee,&#8221; and &#8220;Moby-Dick.&#8221; He is also famous for shorter works such as &#8220;Bartleby, the Scrivener&#8221; and &#8220;Benito Cereno.&#8221;

                
                
                
## Prior to Popularity



He worked as a surveyor for the Erie Canal before taking a position on the crew of a New York ship headed for Liverpool. Later, he sailed on the whaling ship Acushnet, an experience that inspired his masterpiece novel, Moby-Dick.

                
                
                
## Random data



Despite the immense critical acclaim that Moby-Dick has received over the decades, the book was panned by critics at the time of its initial publication, and it ruined Melville&#8217;s literary reputation during his own lifetime.
