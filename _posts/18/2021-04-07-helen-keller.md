Famous American woman who, though deaf and blind, became a women&#8217;s suffragist and leftist political activist. She published twelve books and a number of articles over the course of her life.

                
                
                
## Prior to Popularity



She contracted a disease when she was nineteen months old (likely scarlet fever or meningitis) that left her blind and deaf. As a young child, she developed a repertoire of physical signs which she used to communicate with her parents and with the young daughter of the Keller family&#8217;s cook.

Her life and her childhood education with radical teacher, Anne Sullivan, were immortalized in The Miracle Worker, a Broadway play (and later, Oscar-winning film) based on Keller&#8217;s autobiography, The Story of My Life. Sullivan taught her sign language through the use of a water pump.
