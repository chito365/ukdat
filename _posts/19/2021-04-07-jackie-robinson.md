## Who is Jackie Robinson



The first African American baseball player in the major leagues in the modern era, he helped the Brooklyn Dodgers win the World Series in 1955 and won the National League MVP award in 1949. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.

He joined a gang to combat the exclusion of blacks in Cairo, Georgia, but his friend Carl Anderson convinced him to put his energy elsewhere. He was drafted into a cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas, where the race-neutral Officer Candidate School accepted his application.
