# Early life
                  
                  
                  
His family deceived him as a child, leading him to believe that his mother was his older sister and his grandmother was his mother.
                  
                
                
                
# Trivia
                  
                  
                  
He got the nickname Slowhand because he played the guitar with such ferocity that his strings would break and as he replaced them onstage, the audience would slowly clap their hands.
