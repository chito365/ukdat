## Who is Eli Manning



NFL quarterback who was named MVP of Super Bowls XLII and XLVI while leading the New York Giants to victory over the New England Patriots on both occasions. He was selected first overall by the San Diego Chargers in 2004, then traded directly to the Giants. He is the younger brother of fellow Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning. 

                
                
                
## Prior to Popularity



He decided to attend the University of Mississippi after he received a call from legendary college football coach David Cutcliffe, who also coached his brother at the University of Tennessee. 

                
                
                
## Random data



He was the top prospect in the 2004 NFL Draft but he publicly announced that he wouldn&#8217;t play for the San Diego Chargers if they picked him first overall, so the Chargers were forced to trade his rights to the New York Giants in exchange for another future Pro Bowl quarterback, Philip Rivers.

His unlikely completion to David Tyree, which became known as the &#8220;Helmet Catch,&#8221; late in Super Bowl XLII helped propel the Giants to a 17-14 win and spoiled the Patriots&#8217; hopes of an undefeated season.
