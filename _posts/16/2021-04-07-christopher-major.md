## Who is Christopher Major



Otherwise known as Crash Bandit, he is part of the online hip hop supergroup We Are Toonz. The group is best known for their viral single &#8220;Drop That #NaeNae&#8221; which eventually spawned a remix with hip hop greats Lil Jon, French Montana, and T-Pain.

                
                
                
## Prior to Popularity



Though &#8220;Drop That #NaeNae&#8221; did gain attention locally after it was released, it didn&#8217;t gain a national audience until NBA player Dwight Howard helped them record a video in Atlanta.
